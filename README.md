This is a port of Scratch 2.0 to Flash Player 9.0 (on branch `flash-9`) and
Flash Player 10.0 (on branch `flash-10`).  The Flash 10.0 port required almost
no changes and should be 100% functional compared to Flash 10.2.  However many
things are broken in the Flash 9 port.  This was motivated so Scratch could run
on old platforms like the PlayStation 3.
